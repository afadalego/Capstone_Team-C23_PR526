# Steps to Replicate the Project

1. Machine Learning
- Step 1
- Step 2
- Step n

2. Cloud Computing
- Build the Flask Environment on your local computer and editor (in this case we are using Visual Studio Code)
- Install all the libraries required for the application (Both ML and CC)
- Create a Cloud SQL Instance so we can use MySQL and store our data in the database
- Head over to PhpMyAdmin to create the database and all the tables required. in this case we have 6 tables that are connected to each other using Primary key and Foreign Key
- Code the API based on the Machine Learning's Model's Output using route and the methods for it
- Test if the API is correct and give out the correct results by using Postman
- Create a VM instance in GCP using Compute Engine with your prefered requirements.
- Setup Firewalls and all the dependencies you need like location, storage, etc.
- Once the VM is ready, connect using SSH
- Once you in the SSH install Python and all the required libraries in it
- Deploy the API by running the command "python3 your_file_name.py"
- Test the API again using Postman with the External IP of the VM instance
- If the API has been deployed and gives out correct results then its time to hand it to the Mobile Development
- Monitor the API incase there are any errors or bugs

3. Mobile Development
- Step 1
- Step 2
- Step n
